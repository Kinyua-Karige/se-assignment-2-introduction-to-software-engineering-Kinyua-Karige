  software engineering is a comprehensive discipline that focuses on  the systematic development and maintenance of software using established practices and methodologies, while traditional programming is more focused on the actual writing code without any regards to the structured framework that guides software engineering.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
 1. Planning:Defines the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the project.
 2. Requirement Analysis: Involves determining functional and non-functional requirements.
 3. Design:Create a detailed software architecture and design.
 4. Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code to build the software.
 5. Testing: Verify that the software works as intended and is free of errors.
 6. Deployment: Release the software to the end users.
 7. Maintenance:Provide ongoing support, bug fixes, and enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 1. Waterfall uses linear and sequential approach while agile is iterative and incremental.
 2. Waterfall offers low flexibility to changes while agile has high flexibility.
 3. Waterfall has a lot of documentation while agile is minimalistic in terms of documentation.
 4. Waterfall has higher risk due to late testing and integration while agile has lower risk due to continuous testing and integration

Prefered Use cases
Waterfall Model is preferd where:
    1. Requirements are well defined.
    2. Milestones are clear.
    3. There is less customer involvement.
    4. Suitable for projects with regulatory compliance.
Agile is prefered where:
    1.Projects have evolving requirements.
    2.Projects are customer centric
    3.Projects are complex and largescale


Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

 Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
Requirement gathering process.
 1. Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, observation.
 2. Analyzing and refining the gathered requirements to ensure they are complete, clear, and feasible.
 3. Documenting the requirements in a formal requirements specification document.
 4. Ensuring that the requirements accurately reflect the needs of stakeholders and are feasible within the project constraints.
 5. Managing changes to the requirements over the lifecycle of the project to ensure consistency and traceability.

Importance of Requirement Engineering
 It serves as a crucial foundation for the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring that the end product meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders and users.

Software Design Principles:
     
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
 Modularity in software design is the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, manageable units or modules, each of which encapsulates a specific piece of functionality.

How Modularity Improves Maintainability
 1. Isolated modules can be individually tested and debugged, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
 2. Simlifies updates by allowing changes in one module while not affecting the other parts of the system.
 3. Code is clearely ordanised into logical units
 4. Improves collaboration by allowing multiple developers or teams to work on different modules simultaneously, hence improving productivity and reducing bottlenecks.
 5. Impoves reusability. Modules can be reused across different projects or systems, reducing duplication of effort and improving consistency.










Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
 Unit Testing: Focuses on individual components to ensure they work correctly.
 Integration Testing: Ensures that combined units work together as intended.
 System Testing: Evaluates the complete system against specified requirements.
 Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against business needs and user requirements.
Why is testing crucial in software development?
 testing is crucial in the software development process as it guarantees that the finished product is functional, safe, performant, dependable, maintainable, and user-friendly.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development?
  Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code and other project files over time. 
Importance of VCS.
  1. Facilitate collaboration.
  2. Ensure data safety
  3. Maintain a comprehensive history of changes
  4. Improve code quality.
  5. Allow integration with other tools 
Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
 1. Git- distributed architecture, branching and merging, staging area, speed, collaboration
 2. GitHub- Code hosting, pull requests, issues and rproject tracking, community and social coding.
 3. Bitbucket- Pull requests, Intergration, CI/CD pipelines, both cloud and on-premisw hosting.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager.
 Project Planning and Scope Definition: This involves defining the project scope, which outlines the features and functionalities of the software. They then create a detailed project plan that includes timelines, milestones, resource allocation, and budget.
 Team Leadership and Communication: Effective project managers lead and motivate the development team, ensuring everyone understands their roles and responsibilities. They also facilitate clear communication between developers, designers, clients, and other stakeholders, keeping everyone informed of progress.
 Risk Management: Project managers identify potential risks that could derail the project and develop contingency plans to mitigate them.
 Budget Management: Project managers monitor project costs, identify areas where adjustments might be needed, and keep stakeholders informed of financial progress.

What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
 1. Scope CreepChanges to project scope without corresponding adjustments to budget or timelines.
 2. Resource Constraints:Limited availability of skilled resources or budget constraints.
 3. Technical Complexity: Dealing with complex technical requirements or dependencies.
4. Communication Issues-Poor communication between team members or with stakeholders.
5. Time Constraints-Pressure to meet tight deadlines or unrealistic timelines.
6. Risk Uncertainty-Dealing with unforeseen risks and uncertainties during the project lifecycle.
7. Stakeholder Management: Balancing the needs and expectations of different stakeholders.
8. Quality Control:Ensuring that project deliverables meet the required quality standards.


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. 
 Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying, updating, and enhancing software after it has been delivered and deployed.
Types of Maintenance activity
 i. Corrective Maintenance- Adresses and fixes defects or bugs discovered in the software.
 ii. Adaptive Maintenance-Modifying the software to accommodate changes in the environment eg change in hardware.
 iii. Perfective Maintenance-Enhancing the software to improve performance, usability. This includs adding new featues.
 iv. Preventive Maintenance- Identifies potential issues and addresses them in order to prevent future problems.
Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

 User Satisfaction: Maintenance guarantees that users are satisfied and that the program retains its value by adding features and addressing issues.
                            
    Security: By addressing security flaws, routine maintenance shields the system and its users against online threats.                       
    System Longevity: By keeping the software well-maintained, you can delay the need for expensive rewrites or replacements.                    
    Legal and Regulatory Compliance: In order to adhere to changing legal or regulatory requirements, software may need to be updated.
